Minimal Three.js demo: Sun, Earth (with Moon), and Mars with simple circular orbits.

Cleanup: removed duplicate root assets and kept `css/style.css` and `js/app.js` as the single sources of truth.

Open `index.html` in a local server (for example: `python3 -m http.server 8080`) and visit http://localhost:8080 to view the demo.
